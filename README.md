## BeerApp
Database application project made for myself to keep track of the beers, that I have tasted and ranked.\
SQLite works as a database for this project. This project only works when ran locally. (http://localhost:8080/) \
In order to use this repository and its application, you are going to need a database and change the Database URL inside DBAccounts.java

This project is done by me for the course Ohjelmointi 2 - SOF001AS3A-3002 by Tanja Bergius

###

With this application, you can:
- add a drink to your database
- delete a drink from your database
- edit a drink from your database
- search for drinks in your database through a search bar
- sort your database based on name or id
